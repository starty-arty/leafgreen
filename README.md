## Abstract
The problem we face today is that the candidates' data is scattered among multiple platforms and is not available in a composed and user-friendly manner. We plan on making a  platform which contains verified information about each candidate in a well-organised and easy-to-compare manner.

## Problem
- **Lack of proper information on candidates** Although most of the data of a candidate is public, it is not readily accessible by voters because it may be very scattered.
- **Sensational media** Events and topics which are considered "viral" by the media are overhyped and provide a biased impression of events which tend to manipulate the truth of the story.
- **Possibility of manipulation by candidates and/or accusations of manipulation**
- **Disparity between politicians on basis of money spent on campaign** For instance, the media may tend to provide more coverage of a wealthier candidate that is spending more money on campaigning.

## Solution
We plan to collect all the available data on all candidates and put it on a blockchain. The blockchain will contain everything about the candidate, from their education to their monthly income. Also, all the relevant news articles and coverages will be provided. The data will be verified by a large number of nodes to ensure authenticity. We plan to provide a clean and organised website/app for voters to view. Also the data to be added is verified by more than 50% of the nodes, which is a basic concept of blockchain.
### Why blockchain?
- **Decentralisation** As this there system is implemented using blockchain, there is no one party that has control over the information available to the public.
- **Transparency** of data sources<br>

### Viability of blockchain
- Addition and deletion are rare so computationally not very expensive
- ÃŸSince all data is text based the total size is rather small.

## Utilities
- **Properly organised platform for voters to choose**
- **One platform to provide all relevant information** which saves voters the time and trouble of searching for information on various platforms.
- **Nullifies possibility and accusations of manipulation**
- **Keeps public data public**
